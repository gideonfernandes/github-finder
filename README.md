# github-finder
 This project is a react app that, through the proposed entry, makes requests to the Github API by searching profiles on github and returning information and data, such as profile image, biography, latest repositories, etc. It was developed with the aim of studying the React JS library during the React Front To Back course, taught by @bradtraversy.
